# Objectives

- Use a logistic regression model to compare the log odds of disease in two groups $\Rightarrow$ estimate a crude odds ratio for **a binary exposure**.

- Use a logistic regression model to compare the odds of disease for a categorical exposure with **2 or more levels**.

## Odds and Odds ratio (OR)

- The odds of a disease is defined as:  $$\mathbf{Odds} = \frac{n_{D+}}{n_{D-}}$$ <br> where $D+$ indicates individuals **with disease (such as lung cancer)** <br> $D-$ indicates individuals **without the disease**


- The ratio of the odds between groups is a **measure for comparing the frequency of disease:** $$\mathbf{OR} = \frac{\mathbf{Odds}_{E+}}{\mathbf{Odds}_{E-}}$$ <br> where $E+$ indicates individuals **with exposure (such as smoking)** <br> $E-$ indicates individuals **without the exposure**



---
class:middle
## Logistic regression model in a nutshell

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Odds}_{E+} & = \mathbf{Odds}_{E-} \times \mathbf{OR} \\
\Rightarrow \log(\mathbf{Odds}_{E+}) & = \log(\mathbf{Odds}_{E-}) + \log(\mathbf{OR})
\end{aligned}
$$


Where, <br> $\log(\mathbf{Odds}_{E-})$ is called the **"Baseline log odds in the unexposed group"** <br> $\log(\mathbf{OR})$ is referred as the **"log odds ratio of the exposure"** 


This is an example of a logistic regression model.

# The end

class: middle

## Logistic regression model

**It models the log odds of the disease:**

- Among unexposed individuals $(E-)$: <br> log odds of disease = Baseline

- Among exposed individuals $(E+)$: <br> log odds of disease = Baseline + Exposure

Where, **"Exposure" is the log odds ratio** and the model is **additive**.

So, in any kind of statistical software, logistic regression model does everything on the log odds scale. We/the software can (manually/automatically) convert it back to odds ratio scale, the thing we use to report.

# Why log odds of the disease?

## Why log odds of the disease?



- Linear regression is appropriate for outcome variables like birth weight/height/BMI etc., which are continuous and follows a [normal distribution](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A3%E8%A6%8F%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83).

- When the outcome variables are binary response (died/alive, infected/uninfected, diseased/healthy, succeeded/failed, etc.), it is easier to model the log odds. Because log odds can take any value, positive or negative. But percentages of died/infected/diseased/succeeded are constrained between 0 and 1. 

- All logs are base $e$.

# Example

- [Data](https://github.com/winterwang/logistic-reg-CSS/raw/gh-pages/dataset/mortality.dta) from a study conducted in a rural area of northern Nigeria in the late 1980s to early 1990s. 

- This cohort study with fixed follow-up time included persons aged $\geqslant$ 15 years who all underwent an eye examination by ophthalmic (眼科) nurses. 

- Individuals were classified as visually impaired or with normal vision. 

- Communities were followed-up over a period of 3 years and deaths were identified. 

- We will study the relationship between **the outcome: dead (=1) or alive (=0)**, and **two exposure factors**: 
    - visual impairment as a binary variable (0=unimpaired, 1=visually impaired (including blind))
    - microfilarial infection grouped into 4 levels (negative, <10, 10-49, ≥50 mf/mg).

## Estimate the odds, log odds, and the odds ratio "by hand"

```{r}
# install the package if needed by install.packages("haven")
library(haven)
mortality <- read_dta("dataset/mortality.dta") 
# change your path accordingly
# install the package if needed by install.packages("Epi")
library(Epi)
tab <- stat.table(index = list(Died = died, 
                               "Visually impaired" = vimp),
                   contents = list(count(),percent(died)), 
                  data = mortality, margins = T)
print(tab, digits = 2)
```

### Exercise 1: 

- Fill in the **risk, odds and log odds** of death in the visually impaired and unimpaired individuals.

|          | Unimpaired | Visually impaired | Total  |
|----------|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Risk     |            |          |   $3.19\%$  |
| Odds     |            |          |  $0.0329$  |
| Log odds |            |          |  $-3.414$  |

- What is the Odds Ratio?
- What is the log(odds ratio)?

### Exercise 1: the answers

- Fill in the **risk, odds and log odds** of death in the visually impaired and unimpaired individuals.

|          | Unimpaired | Visually impaired | Total  |
|----------|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Risk     |  $2.44\%$  | $12.23\%$|   $3.19\%$  |
| Odds     | $97/3874 = 0.0250$| $40/287 = 0.1394$|  $0.0329$  |
| Log odds | $\log(0.0250)=-3.68$  |  $\log(0.1394)=-1.97$ |  $-3.414$  |

- What is the Odds Ratio? $$0.1394/0.0250 = 5.576$$
- What is the log(odds ratio)? $$\log(5.576) = -1.97 - (-3.68) = 1.71$$

### Fit the model in R (1)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vimp_logm0 <- glm(died ~ vimp, data = mortality, 
                  family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(vimp_logm0)
```

```
## Call:
## glm(formula = died ~ vimp, family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
##     data = mortality)
## 
## Deviance Residuals: 
##     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  
## -0.5108  -0.2224  -0.2224  -0.2224   2.7247  
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
## `(Intercept)  -3.6873     0.1028 -35.870   <2e-16 ***`
## `vimp          1.7167     0.1976   8.687   <2e-16 ***`
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
## 
## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)
## 
##     Null deviance: 1213.8  on 4297  degrees of freedom
## Residual deviance: 1154.7  on 4296  degrees of freedom
## AIC: 1158.7

- The first column notes the names of the explanatory variable `vimp`. 
- The first row `(Intercept)` refers to the baseline (log odds in the baseline group)
- The second column, labelled `Estimate` is the estimates of the logOdds (unimpaired) logOR for visual impairment

### Recall that the logistic regression model is written as: 

$$\log(\mathbf{Odds}_{E+})  = \log(\mathbf{Odds}_{E-}) + \log(\mathbf{OR})$$

Therefore, we can write down our model:

$$\log(\mathbf{Odds})  = -3.687 + 1.717 \times \mathbf{Vimp}$$

Hence, the log odds: 

- for those with **unimpaired vision**: $\log(\mathbf{Odds}) = -3.687 + 1.717 \times 0 = -3.687$; 

- for those with **visually impaired**: $\log(\mathbf{Odds}) = -3.687 + 1.717 \times 1 = -1.970$

The odds ratio (OR) = $\exp(1.717) = 5.567$

### Look at the output again 


```
## Call:
## glm(formula = died ~ vimp, family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
##     data = mortality)
## {ommitted}
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate `Std. Error` z value Pr(>|z|)    
## (Intercept)  -3.6873     `0.1028` -35.870   <2e-16 ***
## vimp          1.7167     `0.1976`   8.687   <2e-16 ***
## {ommitted}
```

- `Std.Error` can be used to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI): $$\log\mathbf{OR} \pm 1.96\times\mathbf{S.E}$$

Therefore, 

- 95%CI for logOR of `vimp`: $1.7167 \pm 1.96 \times 0.1976 = (1.329, 2.104)$ 

- 95%CI for OR of `vimp`: $(\exp(1.329) = 3.78, \exp(2.104) = 8.19)$

### Fit the model in R (2), turn logOR to OR 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install the package if needed by install.packages("epiDisplay")
library(epiDisplay)
logistic.display(vimp_logm0, decimal = 3)
```


```
## 
## Logistic regression predicting died 
##  
##               `OR(95%CI)`            P(Wald's test) P(LR-test)
## `vimp: 1 vs 0  5.566 (3.779,8.199)  < 0.001        < 0.001`   
##                                                             
## Log-likelihood = -577.36596
## No. of observations = 4298
## AIC value = 1158.73192

## Logistic model for comparison of more than two exposure groups

When the predictor (explanatory) variable has more than 2 levels, all OR are **relative to the baseline group**. 

```{r include=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mortality <- mortality %>% 
  mutate(mfgrp = factor(mfgrp)) %>% 
  mutate(mfgrp = fct_recode(mfgrp, 
                            "Uninfected" = "0", 
                            "< 10"       = "1",
                            "10-49"      = "2", 
                            "50+"        = "3"))
```


```{r}
tab <- stat.table(index = list(Died = died, 
                               "Microfilarial infection mf/mg (grouped)" = mfgrp),
                   contents = list(count(),percent(died)), 
                  data = mortality, margins = T)
print(tab, digits = 2)
```
